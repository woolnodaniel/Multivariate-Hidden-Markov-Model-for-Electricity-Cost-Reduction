# Multivariate-Hidden-Markov-Model-for-Electricity-Cost-Reduction
The problem and code was the result of a university assignment: assignment 2, COMP9418 Advanced Statistical Methods in Machine Learning, UNSW Sydney, Term 3 2020.

See the COMP9418-Assignment-2.pdf for the problem statement. 
See report.pdf for the solution outline, including a full explanation of the model and derivation of the mathematics.

Code includes all the code used to solve the problem. Includes a building simulator for testing. 
Parameters contains all the problem parameters (as csv files) that are loaded by the code in creating the solution. 

Alternatively, the included jupyter notebooks give an interactive demonstration of the code (one for learning the parameters, one for prediction and testing).
